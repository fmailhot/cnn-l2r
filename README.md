# CNN-L2R

Implementation(s) of Severyn and Moschitti's 2015 CNN L2R model, from the paper **Learning to Rank Short Text Pairs with Convolutional Neural Networks**

For now I'll be working on a Keras implementation, but eventually will add a PyTorch one.

See https://github.com/zhangzibin/PairCNN-Ranking for a TF-based implementation.
